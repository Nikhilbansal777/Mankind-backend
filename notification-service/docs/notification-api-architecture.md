# Notification Service API Architecture

## Overview

The Notification Service is responsible for managing and sending notifications to users through various channels (email, SMS, push notifications, etc.). It provides a RESTful API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting notifications.

## Architecture

The Notification Service follows a layered architecture:

1. **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
2. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic
3. **Repository Layer**: Manages data persistence
4. **Model Layer**: Defines data structures

## Components

### Controllers

- `NotificationController`: Exposes REST endpoints for notification management

### Services

- `NotificationService`: Manages notification business logic
- `EmailService`: Handles email notifications
- `SMSService`: Handles SMS notifications
- `PushNotificationService`: Handles push notifications

### Repositories

- `NotificationRepository`: Manages notification data persistence

### Models

- `Notification`: Represents a notification entity
- `NotificationType`: Enum for notification types (EMAIL, SMS, PUSH)
- `NotificationStatus`: Enum for notification statuses (PENDING, SENT, FAILED)

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                      | Description                      |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| GET    | /api/notifications            | Get all notifications            |
| GET    | /api/notifications/{id}       | Get notification by ID           |
| POST   | /api/notifications            | Create a new notification        |
| PUT    | /api/notifications/{id}       | Update an existing notification  |
| DELETE | /api/notifications/{id}       | Delete a notification            |

## Data Flow

1. Client sends a request to create a notification
2. NotificationController receives the request
3. NotificationService processes the request and creates a notification
4. Based on the notification type, the appropriate service (EmailService, SMSService, etc.) is invoked
5. The notification is sent to the user
6. The notification status is updated in the database

## Security

- Authentication: JWT-based authentication
- Authorization: Role-based access control
- Data Validation: Input validation to prevent injection attacks

## Error Handling

- Standard HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages
- Logging of errors for troubleshooting

## Performance Considerations

- Asynchronous processing of notifications
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Caching of frequently accessed data
