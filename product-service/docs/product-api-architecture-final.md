# Product API Architecture - Final

## Overview
This document outlines the final architecture for the Product API in the Mankind Matrix Product Service.

## Components
1. **Controller Layer**
   - ProductController: Handles HTTP requests and responses for product operations

2. **Service Layer**
   - ProductService: Contains business logic for product operations

3. **Repository Layer**
   - ProductRepository: Interfaces with the database for product data operations

4. **Model Layer**
   - Product: Entity representing product data in the database

5. **DTO Layer**
   - ProductDTO: Data Transfer Object for product information

6. **Mapper Layer**
   - ProductMapper: Maps between Product entities and DTOs

## API Endpoints
- GET /api/products - Retrieve all products
- GET /api/products/{id} - Retrieve a specific product
- POST /api/products - Create a new product
- PUT /api/products/{id} - Update an existing product
- DELETE /api/products/{id} - Delete a product

## Data Flow
1. Client sends request to ProductController
2. Controller validates request and passes to ProductService
3. Service performs business logic and interacts with ProductRepository
4. Repository performs database operations
5. Results flow back through the layers to the client

## Security Considerations
- Authentication and authorization for product operations
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Error Handling
- Consistent error responses using ErrorResponse
- Specific exceptions like ProductNotFoundException
- Global exception handling via GlobalExceptionHandler
