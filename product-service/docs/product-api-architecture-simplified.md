# Product API Architecture - Simplified

## Overview
This document provides a simplified overview of the Product API architecture in the Mankind Matrix Product Service.

## Key Components

### Controller (ProductController)
- Entry point for all HTTP requests
- Maps HTTP methods to service methods
- Handles request validation and response formatting

### Service (ProductService)
- Contains business logic
- Orchestrates operations between controllers and repositories
- Handles data transformation and validation

### Repository (ProductRepository)
- Interfaces with the database
- Performs CRUD operations on product data
- Implements JPA repository methods

### Model (Product)
- Represents the product entity in the database
- Contains product attributes and relationships

### DTOs (ProductDTO)
- Transfers data between layers
- Provides a clean interface for client-server communication
- Separates internal and external data representations

## Basic Flow
1. Client sends HTTP request to ProductController
2. Controller validates and routes to appropriate service method
3. Service processes the request using business logic
4. Repository performs database operations as needed
5. Response flows back through service and controller to client

## Simplified API Endpoints
- GET /api/products - List all products
- GET /api/products/{id} - Get product details
- POST /api/products - Create product
- PUT /api/products/{id} - Update product
- DELETE /api/products/{id} - Delete product

## Error Handling
- Consistent error responses
- HTTP status codes reflect outcome
- Descriptive error messages guide clients
