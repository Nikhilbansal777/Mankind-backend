# Product API Architecture

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Product API architecture in the Mankind Matrix Product Service. It details the components, interactions, and design decisions that form the foundation of the service.

## Architecture Layers

### Presentation Layer
- **ProductController**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
  - Implements RESTful endpoints for product operations
  - Performs initial request validation
  - Maps between DTOs and service layer
  - Handles HTTP status codes and response formatting

### Business Logic Layer
- **ProductService**: Implements core business logic
  - Validates business rules and constraints
  - Orchestrates operations across repositories
  - Handles transactional boundaries
  - Implements business-specific operations

### Data Access Layer
- **ProductRepository**: Manages database interactions
  - Extends JpaRepository for standard CRUD operations
  - Implements custom query methods
  - Handles database-specific operations

### Domain Model Layer
- **Product**: Core domain entity
  - Represents the product data structure
  - Contains JPA annotations for ORM mapping
  - Implements business-specific validations

### Data Transfer Objects
- **ProductDTO**: External representation of product data
  - Used for client-server communication
  - Decouples internal and external representations
  - Contains validation annotations

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Exception Handling**: GlobalExceptionHandler for consistent error responses
- **Validation**: Input validation using Bean Validation
- **Mapping**: Object mapping between entities and DTOs using ProductMapper
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization for API endpoints
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging

## Data Flow
1. Client sends HTTP request to a ProductController endpoint
2. Controller validates request format and routes to appropriate service method
3. Service applies business rules and calls repository methods
4. Repository executes database operations
5. Results propagate back through the layers
6. Controller formats the response and returns to client

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/products`: Retrieve all products with pagination and filtering
- `GET /api/products/{id}`: Retrieve a specific product by ID
- `POST /api/products`: Create a new product
- `PUT /api/products/{id}`: Update an existing product
- `DELETE /api/products/{id}`: Delete a product
- `GET /api/products/search`: Search products by various criteria

## Error Handling Strategy
- Use of specific exceptions (ProductNotFoundException, etc.)
- Consistent error response format using ErrorResponse
- Appropriate HTTP status codes for different error scenarios
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Sanitized error messages for production

## Security Considerations
- Authentication using JWT tokens
- Role-based authorization for different operations
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS configuration for web clients

## Performance Optimizations
- Connection pooling for database access
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Pagination for large result sets
- Asynchronous processing for time-consuming operations
