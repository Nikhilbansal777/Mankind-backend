# Address API Documentation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides an overview of the documentation created for the Address API implementation. These documents can be used to explain the implementation during the stand-up meeting and serve as reference material for future development.

## Documentation Files

### 1. Comprehensive Documentation
**File:** `address-api-documentation.md`

This is the main documentation file that provides detailed information about all aspects of the Address API implementation. It includes:

- Database schema details
- Implementation components (Model, DTOs, Repository, Mapper, Service, Controller)
- API endpoint specifications with parameters, responses, and status codes
- Error handling mechanisms
- Example requests from requests.http
- Technical considerations and design decisions

Use this document as a comprehensive reference for all details about the Address API.

### 2. Stand-up Presentation
**File:** `address-api-standup-presentation.md`

This is a simplified version of the documentation designed specifically for the stand-up meeting. It includes:

- A concise summary of what was implemented
- Key features of the API
- Technical implementation highlights
- Example request
- Testing information
- Next steps

Use this document during the stand-up meeting to provide a clear and concise explanation of the implementation.

### 3. Architecture Diagrams
**File:** `address-api-architecture-final.md`

This document provides visual representations of the Address API architecture, including:

- Component diagram showing the overall architecture
- Flow diagram for the Create Address operation
- Text-based descriptions of the Get, Update, and Delete Address flows
- Component responsibilities for each layer

Use this document to explain the architecture and flow of operations during the stand-up meeting.

## How to Use These Documents for the Stand-up Meeting

1. **Start with the Stand-up Presentation**
   - Begin by providing a high-level overview of what was implemented
   - Highlight the key features and technical aspects

2. **Show the Architecture Diagrams**
   - Use the component diagram to explain the overall architecture
   - Walk through the Create Address flow diagram to show how the components interact
   - Briefly explain the other flows (Get, Update, Delete)

3. **Demonstrate with Example Requests**
   - Show the example requests from the documentation
   - Explain how they can be used to test the API

4. **Discuss Technical Considerations**
   - Mention the default address handling logic
   - Explain the security and validation mechanisms

5. **Conclude with Next Steps**
   - Discuss potential improvements or future enhancements

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. **Complete CRUD Operations**
   - The API provides complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for addresses

2. **User-specific Addresses**
   - Addresses are associated with specific users
   - The API validates that users can only access their own addresses

3. **Default Address Handling**
   - Only one address can be set as default for each address type (billing/shipping)
   - When setting an address as default, any existing default address of the same type is automatically set to non-default

4. **Error Handling**
   - Custom exceptions with appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Consistent error response format

5. **Security**
   - All endpoints require authentication with JWT tokens
   - Proper validation of user ownership of addresses

## Conclusion

These documentation files provide a comprehensive explanation of the Address API implementation. They can be used both for the stand-up meeting and as reference material for future development. The stand-up presentation and architecture diagrams are particularly useful for explaining the implementation to team members, while the comprehensive documentation serves as a detailed reference.
