## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

### 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rebeccayilma/MankindMatrixUserService.git
cd MankindMatrixUserService
```

### 2. MySQL Setup

#### A. Start MySQL

Ensure MySQL is running on:
- **Host:** `localhost`
- **Port:** `3306`

#### B. Create Database and User

If you haven't already set up the DB user, paste the contents of `scripts/setup.sql` (found in the Product Service backend project), into MySQL Workbench or run from the CLI.

This sets up:

- A dedicated user with privileges
